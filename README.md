# Double Assessment of Outflow Tract Ventricular Arrhythmias Using Deep Learning Techniques
This is a repository owned by Eric Berenguer (eberpo), containing a project done by *Anna Maria Llopart*, *Laura Montserrat*, and *Eric Berenguer*. This project was presented at Universitat Pompeu Fabra and done with the support and resources provided by said university.
The contents of the repository consist of the report and slides used for the project presentation and a python notebook in which the code used for the project has been gathered and executed. The repository DOES NOT contain the data used in the project since it is unclear if it can be in public domain in a raw form, but the data used and its structure is explained in the report.

## Reduced version of the abstract in the report:
This project comprehensively covered the clinical context, methodologies and processes that contributed to the creation of  two models that used a combination of ECG signals and patient data to classify the origin of Idiopathic Arrhythmias in certain parts of the heart. 
The first model aimed for a classification between arryhtmias originating in Right or Left Outflow Ventriclular tracts (LVOT-RVOT). 
The purpose of the second model was for the distinction of two different specific sites of origin (SOO): Left Coronary Cusp (LCC) and Left Ventricular Summit (LVS) of outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias (OTVA). 
Both models used deep learning networks, the first one a Recurrent Neural Network and a Multi-Layer Perceptron and the second a Convoluional Neural Network, as well as signal processing and dimensionality reduction techniques. Both also produced positive results that could be improved if a larger quantity of data could be found.
