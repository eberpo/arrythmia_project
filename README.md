# Double Assessment of Outflow Tract Ventricular Arrhythmias Using Deep Learning Techniques
This repository contains a project done by *Eric Berenguer*, *Anna Maria Llopart*, and *Laura Montserrat*. This project was presented at Universitat Pompeu Fabra and was done with the support and resources provided by the university. 

The contents of the repository consist of the report and slides used for the project presentation and a Python notebook in which the code used for the project has been gathered and executed for illustrative purposes. The repository DOES NOT contain the data used in the project since it is unclear if it can be in the public domain in a raw form, but the data used and its structure are explained in the report.

## A reduced version of the abstract in the report:
This project comprehensively covered the clinical context, methodologies, and processes that contributed to creating two models that used a combination of ECG signals and patient data to classify the origin of Idiopathic Arrhythmias in certain parts of the heart.

The first model aimed to classify between arrhythmias originating in Right or Left Outflow Ventriclular tracts (LVOT-RVOT).

The purpose of the second model was to separate two different specific sites of origin (SOO): Left Coronary Cusp (LCC) and Left Ventricular Summit (LVS) of outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias (OTVA).

Both models used deep learning networks, the first one a Recurrent Neural Network and a Multi-Layer Perceptron and the second a Convolutional Neural Network, as well as signal processing and dimensionality reduction techniques. Both also produced positive results that could be improved if more data could be found.
