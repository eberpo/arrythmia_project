# Double Assessment of Outflow Tract Ventricular Arrhythmias Using Deep Learning Techniques

This is a repository owned by Eric Berenguer (eberpo), containing a project done by Anna Maria Llopart, Laura Montserrat, and Eric Berenguer. This project was presented at Universitat Pompeu Fabra.
The contents of the repository consist of the report and slides used for the project presentation and a python notebook in which the code used for the project has been gathered and executed. The repository DOES NOT contain the data used in the project since it is unclear if it can be in public domain in a raw form, but the data used and its structure is explained in the report.

### Reduced version of the abstract in the report:
This project comprehensively covered the clinical context, methodologies and processes that contributed to the creation of the two models: one used for the classification of the ventricle of idiopathic arrhythmias of origin (LVOT-RVOT) and another for two different specific sites of origin (SOO): Left Coronary Cusp (LCC) and Left Ventricular Summit (LVS) of outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias (OTVA). The models used deep learning as well as signal processing and dimensionality reduction techniques.
